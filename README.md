Q1. Stack Using Array Definition of Stack A Stack is a linear data structure in which insertion and deletion of elements are performed only from one end, called the TOP. A stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, which means the element inserted last is removed first. Example: TOP ↓ | 30 | ← Last inserted |----| | 20 | |----| | 10 | ← First inserted |----| If we perform POP(), the element 30 will be removed first.

Definition of Array-Based Stack An array-based stack is a stack implemented using an array to store elements and a variable called TOP to keep track of the position of the topmost element. Initially: top = -1; When an element is inserted, top is increased. When an element is deleted, top is decreased. Basic Stack Operations

PUSH(x) Definition: PUSH(x) is an operation used to insert a new element x at the top of the stack. If the stack is already full, the PUSH operation cannot be performed and Stack Overflow occurs.

POP() Definition: POP() is an operation used to remove and return the topmost element from the stack. If the stack is empty, the POP operation cannot be performed and Stack Underflow occurs.

PEEK() Definition: PEEK() is an operation used to view or return the topmost element of the stack without removing it. If the stack is empty, there is no top element to display.

DISPLAY() Definition: DISPLAY() is an operation used to display all the elements present in the stack, starting from the TOP element to the bottom element. Stack Overflow – Definition Stack Overflow is a condition that occurs when we try to insert a new element into a stack that is already full. For a stack of size 5: 10 20 30 40 50 ↑ TOP If we perform: PUSH(60) the stack cannot accept the new element, so Stack Overflow occurs. Condition: top == MAX - 1 Stack Underflow – Definition Stack Underflow is a condition that occurs when we try to delete or access an element from a stack that is empty. For an empty stack: TOP = -1 If we perform: POP() then Stack Underflow occurs. Condition: top == -1 Complexity Operation Time Complexity Meaning PUSH O(1) Insert one element POP O(1) Remove one element PEEK O(1) Access top element DISPLAY O(n) Visit all elements Overall Space Complexity: O(n) because an array of size n is used to store the stack elements.
